FOR ARDUINO: IMPORT FROM LIBRARIES FOR BEST RESULTS. DO NOT USE MULTIPLE OF SAME LIBRARY
IF MCP2515 DOES NOT WORK FROM LIB BELOW, SEARCH FOR "MCP2515" IN "LIBRARIES"
AND IMPORT THAT ARDUINO FILE INTO YOUR NATIVE ARDUINO "LIBRARIES" (IN DOCUMENTS/ARDUINO/LIBRARIES)

DEPENDANCIES:

Arduino:
-	Mosquitto MQTT broker (type mosquitto -v to check if running)
-	Arduino Uno Wifi Dev Ed Library by Arduino
-	Adafruit BNO055 by Adafruit
-	Adafruit BusIO by Adafruit
-	Adafruit Unified Sensor by Adafruit
-	ArduinoJson by Benoit Blanchon
-	SparkFun I2C GPS Reading and Control by Sparkfun
-	SparkFun u-blox GNSS v3 by Sparkfun
-	TinyGPSPlus by Mikal Hart
-	Autowp-mcp2515 by autowp
-	Wifi_logins.h (custom credentials file placed in libraries or with local ino file) 

Python: (set_AK_motor_speed.py does not work from spyder due to PIP, use cmd or terminal)
-	Paho MQTT (DOES NOT WORK UNLESS YOU STATICALLY ASSIGN YOUR COMPUTERS IP TO THE UBIQUITI NETWORK... ALL DEVICES NEED TO BE MANUALLY ASSIGNED IPs)
-	evdev on linux (note that every new install of evdev requires remapping of controller buttons)
-	json (should be native to all pythons)
